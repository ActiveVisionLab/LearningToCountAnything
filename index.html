    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Object counting is a seemingly simple task with diverse real-world applications. Most counting methods focus on
      counting instances of specific, known classes. While there are class-agnostic counting methods that can generalise
      to unseen classes, these methods require reference images to define the type of object to be counted, as well as
      instance annotations during training. We identify that counting is, at its core, a repetition-recognition task and
      show that a general feature space, with global context, is sufficient to enumerate instances in an image without a
      prior on the object type present. Specifically, we demonstrate that self-supervised vision transformer features
      combined with a lightweight count regression head achieve competitive results when compared to other
      class-agnostic counting tasks without the need for point-level supervision or reference images. Our method thus
      facilitates counting on a constantly changing set composition. To the best of our knowledge, we are both the first
      reference-less class-agnostic counting method as well as the first weakly-supervised class-agnostic counting
      method.

    <h2>Visualisation of the Latent Counting Features</h2>
    <p>
      We overlay the two most significant
      feature channels (shown in red and green) of the penultimate layer of our counting head on images from FSC-147.
      The ground truth and predicted counts are in the top left and the top right of each image respectively
